# Name: 	step_back
#
# Description:	Pops the most recently changed tile off the top of the
#		stack and returns its address.
#		If we try to step back past the start of the puzzle, 
#		impossible puzzle is triggered from here.
#
# Arguments:	None
#		
#
# Returns:	The address of the square we stepped back to in the board 
#		array.

# Name: 	step_forward
#
# Description: 	pushes the tile we're about to change onto the stack.
#
# Arguments: 	a0: the address of the square we're setting in the board array
#
# Returns: 	Nothing
